## Technical Screencast
It was suggested that we upload the technical screencast to GitHub.

However, since GitHub has a 100 megabyte file size limit, I've had to **highly** compress the 1.3 gigabyte video.

As a result, the video is quite blurry, but it should still be watchable!

Just in case you have trouble viewing the video, I have included a link to the video on YouTube below.

I have also included a link to the video on my Google Drive, in case you want to download it.
